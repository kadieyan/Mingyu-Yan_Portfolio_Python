**Yelp Data Analysis (SQL)**                                                               
Apr 2020 – May 2020

•	Profiling and Understanding. Observed the dataset by filtering, ordering and grouping records in the dataset and doing quantitative calculation

•	Inferences and Analysis. Analyzed how the location, the number of reviews, and the number of photos showed influenced the stores’ star ratings by joining different tables and processing data

**Gender Recognition by Voice (Python & R)**                                                   
Jan 2020 – Mar 2020

•	Built a machine learning model in Python to recognize gender by voice with 20K+ voice data

•	Oversampling with SMOTE. Solved data imbalance problem by oversampling the raw data with SMOTE, in order to reduce modeling errors

•	Dimensionality Reduction. Reduced data dimension by using t-SEN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

•	GridSearch & ROC curve. Applied GridSearch to Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); Using ROC curve to find out the model with best performance

•	Deep Neuron Network (DNN). Trained Deep Neural Network models with different number layers with different batch sizes and activation function, and selected the best model based on mean absolute error (MAE)

**Facial Expression Recognition (Python)**                                                     
Jan,2020 – Feb,2020

•	Developed a deep learning model to classify facial expression and applied it to real world facial recognition

•	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built a CNN model with 8 layers – 3 convolution layers, 3 pooling layers, 1 flatten layer, and 1 dense layer, and adjusted the model to achieve highest validation accuracy

•	Accuracy Threshold. Defined a callback function to stop the training when given accuracy achieved to reduce unnecessary training time

**Sentiment Analysis of Shareholder Letters from Berkshire Hathaway (Python)**                      
Jan 2020 – Feb 2020

•	Discovered the latent semantic structures in the shareholder letters and predicted possible content of shareholder letter

•	Text Mining. Preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words

•	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model. Trained LSTM model with different number layers with different dropout rate and activation function, selected the best parameter combination based on prediction accuracy and loss

**New York Airbnb Price Analysis (R)**                                                         
Oct 2019 – Dec 2019

•	Worked on NYC Airbnb dataset and analyzed the potential key factors that determine the price of a listing Airbnb

•	Visualization. Utilized ggplot and plotly to generate box plot, fan chart, bar chart and histogram to explore the data

•	Supervised Learning Model. Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models to determine the key factors that affected the price
